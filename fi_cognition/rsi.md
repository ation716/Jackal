# RSI

## what's rsi?

- rsi (Relative Strength Index) is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and change of price movements, oscillating between 0 and 100.
- The RSI can help traders identify potential entry and exit points by looking for divergences and failure swings.
- Its primary purpose is to identify overbought (potentially overvalued, likely for a pullback) or oversold (potentially undervalued, likely for a bounce) conditions in a security.

## Calculation

- Calculated using a specific formula over a defined period (commonly 14 periods -days,hours,minutes,etc.)
- The formula involves comparing the magnitude of recent average gains to recent average losses::
  $RSI= 100-[100/1+(average gain/average loss)]$
- The average gain or loss used in this calculation is the average percentage gain or loss during a look-back period.
